# 🧭 Explainable UI Lab — Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **Explainable UI Lab**.
These notes explore how machine learning **explanations** can be made more **visual, intuitive, and trustworthy** through thoughtful UI design.

### 📚 Documentation Index

* [🧬 Data Explanation](./data.md)
  Overview of the breast cancer dataset, feature meanings, and why “worst” features dominate.

* [⚙️ Code Explanation](./code.md)
  Step-by-step guide to how the Python notebook trains the model, computes SHAP values, and exports JSON for the UI layer.

* [📊 Visualization Explanation](./visualizations.md)
  How the exported data is visualized in the frontend — bar and waterfall charts, color mapping, and design considerations for interpretability.

### 🔮 Future Topics

Ideas and experiments to expand the Explainable UI Lab:

* **Counterfactual Exploration:** Interactive “what-if” sliders to test how changing a feature affects the prediction.
* **Monotonicity Visualization:** Show which features are constrained to only influence predictions in one direction (business logic alignment).
* **Global vs Local Explainability:** Compare feature importance across the entire dataset versus individual predictions.
* **Human Factors in XAI:** Designing explanations for cognitive clarity and emotional trust, not just accuracy.
* **Dashboard Patterns:** Building multi-view explainability dashboards that combine metrics, charts, and narrative context.

### 🔒 About This Repository

This project is a **personal learning and experimentation space**.
It’s public for transparency and reference, but not open for outside contributions or issues.
If you stumble on it and find something useful — awesome.
Otherwise, think of it as a peek inside one developer’s explainability sandbox.
