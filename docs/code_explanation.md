You load the dataset. That’s just a table: columns = nucleus shape stats, target = benign/malignant. Train/test split keeps you honest by hiding 20% for grading later.

You fit a Gradient Boosting model. It’s a team of tiny decision trees voting together. Each new tree fixes the last tree’s mistakes. That’s why it’s strong and nonlinear.

`predict_proba` gives the model’s confidence for class 1. You score with AUC. Bigger is better. If you see ~0.98 here, the model is cruising.

You build a SHAP explainer. Under the hood it approximates each feature’s “credit” using game theory. The base value is the average model output if it knew nothing about this person.

`shap_values = explainer(X_test)` computes a contribution for every feature on every row. Positive weights push the probability up. Negative pull it down. Sum of weights plus base ≈ the final prediction.

When you grab `row_idx = 0`, you’re slicing one person’s story. `sv.values` is the vector of feature impacts for that one prediction. That’s your bar chart fuel.

Your quick matplotlib plot sorts by absolute impact. That surfaces the features that mattered most for this decision, regardless of direction. It’s your “top suspects” list.

The JSON export is you packaging that story for the UI. You stash the base value, final prediction, raw inputs, and the per-feature weights. Your React chart just reads and draws. No ML in the frontend. Clean separation.

Why “worst” features feel big: they capture the most abnormal nucleus in the image. Cancer screams in extremes. SHAP hears the scream and shows it as long bars.

Monotonicity would be a promise on direction. You didn’t set any here, but if you did, the UI should never show a forbidden sign flip.

If you want to sanity-check the math, manually add `baseValue + sum(weights)` and compare to the model’s log-odds or use `shap.utils._convert_to_link` for the right space. For tree models with default link, SHAP gives contributions in logit space; Explainer will map to probability in plots, but your JSON keeps raw weights. Just be consistent when you narrate.
